Job application tracking application. Built using Java and Angular.

### What it does? ###
Was previously using a Google Sheets document to track job applications which was tedious so decided to build application that is easier to use. Currently can see submitted jobs and edit them. Also includes table of jobs 2 weeks out from submission. 
Currently running using Java Spring Repository, plan to change to MySQL.
